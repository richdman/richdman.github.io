I've been working with Sitecore as a technology since version 5.3 was launched. I've moved on to architecting some of the largest Sitecore solutions in the UK including hsbc.com, Euromoney Plc, Universal Music and ASOS.com and I started this blog because it's time to start sharing some of the things I've learnt over the last 12 years.
