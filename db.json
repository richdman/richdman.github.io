angel](/images/wishlist/sitecore-angel.png \"sitecore angel\")\n\nThis post is dedicated to a wishlist of what we would like to see from features to documentation and everything in between. \nPlease feel free to comment below or email me on <rdias@1digit.co.uk> if you want me to add something to this list, correct me or let me know if a wish has been granted.\n<!--more-->\n\n## Features\n### Workflow & Workbox\nI've been working with Sitecore since version 5.3 and I must say that the workbox seems to have hardly changed.\nWe are selling Sitecore to clients with thousands of content items, globally distributed authoring teams and this content is often constantly changing. The current workbox isn't suitable for large volumes of content and authors are often requesting to bypass the Sitecore workflow altogether which is a very bad thing.\nStart thinking about:\n* Redoing the UI to make approving large numbers of content realistic\n* Better methods of grouping content and assiging to individual approvers\n* Using the search index to power the new workflow UI\n* SXA is out, we can start approving partial designs/ composites etc as a whole\n\n### Media cropping OTB\nOne of the biggest issues we see on many Sitecore websites is the fact that content authors seem to upload and use very large (200KB<) images on their site. They often allocate for the best looking image on Macbook Pro Retina screens without any notion of what this would do to a mobile site for example.\nLarger page weights also get penalised by google so this is another loss.\n\nSitecore has a great media processing pipeline which will let you pass in parameters for width and height, you can use this to resize images and you can set the process quality to around 75 to get really good image compression.\n\nThe problem is that most websites need to have different aspect ratios for an individual image and simply resizing will not do, we need to be able to crop and optimize.\n\n#### Sitecore Modules\nThere is a nice tool in the marketplace now:\n* [Image field with cropping](https://marketplace.sitecore.net/Modules/I/ImageCropping.aspx?sc_lang=en \"Image field with cropping Sitecore module\"), this needs some tweaking for us to define a fixed/limited number of crops per site, otherwise it does a great job.\n\n#### DAM's (Digital Asset Management)\nThere DAM integrations like [Digizuite](https://www.digizuite.com/digital-asset-management-for-sitecore \"Digizuite sitecore integration\") (which at the time of writing has the most complete DAM integration with Sitecore) and Sitecore has recently acquired [Stylelabs](https://www.sitecore.com/en-gb/company/press-and-media/press-releases/2018/10/sitecore-to-acquire-innovative-content-marketing-software-vendor-stylelabs \"Sitecore aquires Stylelabs\") (which will do the job). Both of these have cropping functionality (and much more), the problem is that that these are paid services and have a lot more functionality and a pricetag to match. \n\nSitecore should have a middle-ground solution that comes with the core platform.\n\n### Personalisation with CDN\nAt the moment Sitecore does all of its personalisation on the client side unless you start using some JSS functionality.\nIf you're a client with a global presense (and there are a lot of these) who needs to cover more than one geographical region and don't want to spend large sums on a geographically distributed CD node system then you will most likely be using a CDN like Akamai, Cloudlare or any number of players.\nIf we want to make use of Sitecores' rich personalisation and analytics we won't be able to edge cache the actual documents (Media or any other assets are not an issue). If we edge cache the document then the persona profiling won't work nor will other personalisation functionality.\nSitecore needs to move personalisation and content profiling to the client side so that working with CDN's won't hinder any Sitecore functionality.\n\n## Development\n### Async Sitecore Controllers\nPlease please can we have async controllers? the ability to mark renderings as async would be fantastic, this means non-essential renderings can be loaded asynctonously without our pages needing to 'wait' for them. The sooner the server can respond with the DOM the better.\n```csharp\npublic async Task<ActionResult> MarketingTile()\n```\nHere is a nice article about [how async methods work](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/performance/using-asynchronous-methods-in-aspnet-mvc-4 \"Using Asynchronous Methods in ASP.NET MVC 4\") in ASP.NET.\n\n## Documentation\n### Better scaling guidelines\n\n## Examples\nWhat can Sitecore provide in terms of examples, tutorials and demo enviornments?\n\n### Helix & Habitat  &#10004;\nThis was going to be about providing better Helix project examples than Habitat.

The current workbox isn't suitable for large volumes of content and authors are often requesting to bypass the Sitecore workflow altogether which is a very bad thing.\nStart thinking about:\n* Redoing the UI to make approving large numbers of content realistic\n* Better methods of grouping content and assiging to individual approvers\n* Using the search index to power the new workflow UI\n* SXA is out, we can start approving partial designs/ composites etc as a whole\n\n### Media cropping OTB\nOne of the biggest issues we see on many Sitecore websites is the fact that content authors seem to upload and use very large (200KB<) images on their site. They often allocate for the best looking image on Macbook Pro Retina screens without any notion of what this would do to a mobile site for example.\nLarger page weights also get penalised by google so this is another loss.\n\nSitecore has a great media processing pipeline which will let you pass in parameters for width and height, you can use this to resize images and you can set the process quality to around 75 to get really good image compression.\n\nThe problem is that most websites need to have different aspect ratios for an individual image and simply resizing will not do, we need to be able to crop and optimize.\n\n#### Sitecore Modules\nThere is a nice tool in the marketplace now:\n* [Image field with cropping](https://marketplace.sitecore.net/Modules/I/ImageCropping.aspx?sc_lang=en \"Image field with cropping Sitecore module\"), this needs some tweaking for us to define a fixed/limited number of crops per site, otherwise it does a great job.\n\n#### DAM's (Digital Asset Management)\nThere DAM integrations like [Digizuite](https://www.digizuite.com/digital-asset-management-for-sitecore \"Digizuite sitecore integration\") (which at the time of writing has the most complete DAM integration with Sitecore) and Sitecore has recently acquired [Stylelabs](https://www.sitecore.com/en-gb/company/press-and-media/press-releases/2018/10/sitecore-to-acquire-innovative-content-marketing-software-vendor-stylelabs \"Sitecore aquires Stylelabs\") (which will do the job). Both of these have cropping functionality (and much more), the problem is that that these are paid services and have a lot more functionality and a pricetag to match. \n\nSitecore should have a middle-ground solution that comes with the core platform.\n\n### Personalisation with CDN\nAt the moment Sitecore does all of its personalisation on the client side unless you start using some JSS functionality.\nIf you're a client with a global presense (and there are a lot of these) who needs to cover more than one geographical region and don't want to spend large sums on a geographically distributed CD node system then you will most likely be using a CDN like Akamai, Cloudlare or any number of players.\nIf we want to make use of Sitecores' rich personalisation and analytics we won't be able to edge cache the actual documents (Media or any other assets are not an issue). If we edge cache the document then the persona profiling won't work nor will other personalisation functionality.\nSitecore needs to move personalisation and content profiling to the client side so that working with CDN's won't hinder any Sitecore functionality.\n\n## Development\n### Async Sitecore Controllers\nPlease please can we have async controllers? the ability to mark renderings as async would be fantastic, this means non-essential renderings can be loaded asynctonously without our pages needing to 'wait' for them.
